# vistacompile
Repository where we place special vistasoft functions that we compile for containers

See isetcompile for a longer description of the format.  At some point we will create a common link or wiki page for isetcompile and vistacompile.

We will move some of the scitran-apps cases here.

A major goal of both isetcompile and vistacompile is to put Matlab Runtime Compiler code into a Docker container, and then wrap the whole thing in a Gear that runs in Flywheel.  Or in Franco's brain-life thing.
